# Akaunting-Module_example
Worked example of overriding output in Akaunting for an invoice print

Installed via the weird steps of:-

run `php artisan modules:make FooBar` will create a default module
Now delete teh contents of teh FooBar directory and copy the contents of the working FooBar into it

run `php artisan modules:dump` should make teh module workable
